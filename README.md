# sleeper_fantasy_football_api
Creates Datasets for Sleeper Fantasy Football in two easy steps

### Two Easy Steps

1. Update config.yaml to use your league_id
2. run $ python get_all_sleeper_data.py

Also every once in awhile you'll need to un-comment a line in get_all_sleeper_data.py
- get_all_player_names(sport=sport)

Please make sure to re-comment that as it slows down performance!
